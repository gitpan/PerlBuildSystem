paths INSTALL
===========

Installing paths takes time!

This is the first module of this size we prepare and the first where we try to 
support windows as well as Linux. Please be patient and give us feedback so we
can make the installation easier.

The system is tested on Linux and windows. I believe it should work on cygwin but
I did not check that. I have heard of a user who is trying it on BSD.

We are 4 engineers using paths everyday for our work on windows and Linux so this
is possible to install!

Let' us know how easy it went for you so we can help the other users.

Installing on Linux:
====================

This is my development OS and paths mostly tested on Linux too.

paths use Module::Build which is supported by 'cpanp'. Unfortunately not all
modules install smoothly in 'cpanp'. I have just installed on a fresh gentoo box
It took me 1 hours to install.

I recommend installing 'cpanp' and trying to install from there. If some modules
don't install, try installing them in 'cpan' or emerge.

paths now comes with a Makefile.PL that should make the installation via 'cpan' possible.

If everything fails (or just some) drop me a line and I'll try to get you up and
running.


Manual install:
===============

download the module
tar xzf PerlBuildSystem-version.tgz
perl Build.PL
./Build test
sudo ./Build install

Install the missing modules with cpan. This works OK but takes time.

Installing on windows:
======================

You are a bit out of luck as the install is more difficult and the run time is
higher as windows file caching is rather bad (as is the network layer).

90% of the problems you'll encounter will come from dependencies paths has. I report
these problems to the module authors but there's not much I can do. Jungling with
cpan and ppm fix the problem.

SETUP
=====
once you have installed paths, you need too set the following:

$paths_FLAGS holds flags that you would normaly give on the command line.
**********

My variable only contains '-c' so I get colored output.

$paths_LIB_PATH this contains the paths to the paths module you access through 'pathsUse'.
*************

Mine, for example, contains:
/devel/perl_modules/PerlBuildSystem-0.34


The default paths Lib is now installed under paths installation in the perl module directory

$paths_PLUGIN_PATH contains the path to paths plugins
****************

ex: /devel/perl_modules/PerlBuildSystem-0.34/Plugins

The default paths plugins is now installed under paths installation in the perl module directory

$USER
*****

Your name. This is used to put paths output in a the right directory if you are multiple users on
your box (this is also needed on single user machines)

test HELLO WORLD
================

on linux:

change to the paths installation directory.
change to pathsfiles/hello

run this command 'paths -dpu -dpt'. It will build an hello world example. This should
work on any "standard" linux installation. the -dpu switch tells paths to show you
where the paths modules come from. -dpt shows you some timing information.
