PBS INSTALL
===========

Installing PBS takes time!

This is the first module of this size we prepare and the first where we try to 
support windows as well as Linux. Please be patient and give us feedback so we
can make the installation easier.

The system is tested on Linux and windows. I believe it should work on cygwin but
I did not check that. I have heard of a user who is trying it on BSD.

We are 4 engineers using PBS everyday for our work on windows and Linux so this
is possible to install ;)

Let' us know how easy it went for you so we can help the other users.

Installing on Linux:
====================

This is my development OS and it's mostly tested on Linux too.

PBS use Module::Build which is supported by 'cpanp'. Unfortunately not all
modules install smoothly in 'cpanp'. I have just installed on a fresh gentoo box
It took me 1 hours to install.

I recommend installing 'cpanp' and trying to install from there. If some modules
don't install, try installing them in 'cpan' or emerge/urpme.

I got it fairly easy to install with version 0.32. It still failed some test due
to a Graph.pm dependency that wouldn't install.

If everything fails (or just some) drop me a line and I'll try to get you up and
running.


Manual install:
===============

download the module
tar xzf PerlBuildSystem-version.tgz
perl Build.PL
./Build test
sudo ./Build install

Install the missing modules with cpan. This works OK but takes time.

Installing on windows:
======================

You are a bit out of luck as the install is more difficult and the run time is
higher as windows file caching is rather bad (as is the network layer).

... more to be added when NKH has seen EJ do the install on windows


SETUP
=====
once you have installed PBS, you need too set the following:

$PBS_FLAGS holds flags that you would normaly give on the command line.
**********

My variable only contains '-c' so I get colored output.

$PBS_LIB_PATH this contains the pathes to the PBS module you access through 'PbsUse'.
*************

Mine, for example, contains:
/devel/perl_modules/PerlBuildSystem-0.34

$PBS_PLUGIN_PATH contains the path to PBS plugins
****************

ex: /devel/perl_modules/PerlBuildSystem-0.34/Plugins


HELLO WORLD
===========

on linux:

change to the PBS installation directory.
change to test/hello

run this command 'pbs -dpu'. It will build an hello world example. This should
work on any "standard" linux installation. the -dpu switch tells PBS to show you
where the PBS modules come from. -dpt shows you some timing information.
