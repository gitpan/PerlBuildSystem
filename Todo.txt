Perl Build System
=================

Remove spurious PBSFILE HELP for -hu -hur output

Add creator for C files

#Check if CREATOR can be mixed with other rule types
	#=> including CREATOR multiple times

extra arguments to depender should be passed as a ref to @

Test for -gtg only if graphviz is installed

#? AR [x => y], BuilderAndCreator(\creator) ;
	=> AR [CREATOR], 'name', ['A' => 'B4], "touch %FILE_TO_BUILD" ;
	
Information.pm could reuse some function defined in NodeBuilder.pm

#Should we ignore (or even warn) if  a rule with creator also has a builder?

check if $C_dependencies_cache and $Creator_dependencies_cache shouldn't be flushed

#wizard info and help

Release
	Batch::PBS
	#Data::Dumper
	#Devel::Depend::Cpp/Cl
	#PBS

The parsing and handling of the type of the rule should be left to perl	like we do with AddRule. 
	=> SR[], => PR[] ...
	=> we need overloading a la C++

ShellCommandGenerator in Builders.pm re-evaluates PBS_REPOSITORIES for every node
	but BuilderFromStringOrArray doesn't! in any case the way to re-evaluate
	PBS_REPOSITORIES modifies the config for all the nodes sharing the
	pbs_config.

	what about the special %PBS_REPOSITORIES handling in Config.pm
	
handle -I vs /I in shell commands with %FILE_TO_BUILD
	
language simplified should also handle a plugin to make it possible to add, say, $build_directory, ...
	=> euuu! $build_directory in the dependency definition !!!!!???

We need a unified way to present output, whatever mode we are running in
	ex modes: progress_bar, -j, -ubs, -so, ...
	node header missing when node build fails (when not in -j mode)

C_Depender and warp 1.5 dewarpifier could be the same code

_warp 1.5 doesn't rebuild the ancestor tree
	=> OK, warp is not made for searching, only be fast

^ C dependencies cache doesn't rebuild ancestors properly

We should display a warning when intermediate file is excluded from digest
	=> intermediate files should _aways_ have a digest
	=> or is it nodes with builders that should always have a digest
		what about having a creator?

At check or just after, a 30 MB memory usage boost appears???

document what warp 1.5 does, specially regeneration

_ We rebuild too much! when C_depender changes, we should rebuild only if the dependencies change md5.

when compiling error occurs open build buffer in editor
	=> What about listing the file names somewhere where a post pbs or a script could take over?
	=> this assumes the build buffers are kept

^^^^ AddEnvironmentDependencies does not work with warp as do the other AddDependency functions (Add Switch)

-p pbsfile displays warning about relocating pbsfile ????
	=> couldn't reproduce at home!
	
Is LOCAL_NODES really needed when the node does have a a different path

META_NODE 1
	one node is multiple files in the filesystem
	
Create a term and acronymes section

allow creation of builders that generate shell commands
	=>type the builders or modify all the builders to have a special mode (bof)
		ShellCommand(\&DoSomething, 'arg', 'arg') ;
		sub DoSomething : ShellCommandsOnly
		
	? should creators be tagged in that way too?
	
document how to write a builder override

Stop using closures!
	=> have minimized some of them in the builders section

_ verify config when linking to existing node?

_ parallel C depending
	it it possible to build the dependency graph without C depend, depend each C
	file separately and parallely then merge each C file dependencies back into
	the dependency graph

...? micro warp file for each subpbs
	=> usefull if the whole warp tree must be rebuild . ex a Pbsfile is changed
	=> not realy usefull in common case where pbs is run in warp mode
	=> might be used to speed up warp file creation which become a list of micro warps
	
	=> decentralize warp files.
		each warp file would depend on it's own dependencies instead for the global warp file to depend on all
		Only the warp file part would need to be rebuild. 
		We might even be able to restart building from a specific node instead for the root
		another example is subpbses, they could have their own warp files
	
	=> hmmm isn't this no more than adding the pbsfiles as dependencies to the nodes?
		=> except it is top down instead for bottom up!!!!
		
	=> if every node in the tree has a dependency to a pbsfile-node, a modification in a pbs file
		would 'trigger' the nodes, except that children to the triggered
		nodes must also be removed as we don't know if they are part of the warp tree or not
		
Optimize memory usage
	=> no separate packages for each subpbs
	=> no reload of rules
	=> hashes are expensive (but so cool)

find a pre_processor within a module

find a way to build with light weight processes
	=> worker pool
		socket communication so the workers can be remote if needed
	=> use an existing RPC module if possible

_builders using shell commands only should automatically generate warp2 stubs
	=> what about adding it to the tree through a node sub?
		=> meta rules are a bit more difficult
	=> getting it as a result from the builder
		=> builders can serialize themselves
		=> need a special mode when building Warp2 data
			for nodes already build
			
^when merging nodes in c_depender, shouldn't we set dependent too get ancestors properly?
	=> yes, __DEPENDENCY_TO should be set or we get an error.

^C file was removed when it couldn't be depended !!!!!
	made an error in the include path, forgot -I
	
Change ImportTrigger(file) to Import(file, Trigger) ;

...trigger inserted nodes are searched in $inserted_nodes only this means that trigger
	inserted nodes from a sub pbs with LOCAL_NODES will NOT be found!
	=> keep all the LOCAL_$inserted_nodes in a list
		this would make it easy to know how many nodes we really have in the tree
		warp 1.1 wouldn't neet to traverse a tree (hmmm, how do we rebuild multiple trees ?)
		The original $inserted nodes should be in the list too
		PBS could push $inserted nodes in the list when is is not defined .?

Remove spurious references to full path C files introduced by depender

make warp2 give the possibility to modify the warp tree without running the subpbs
make warp2 -j and - distributor aware
rewrite the rule generator so shell only commands can be warp2 enabled automatically

warp2 tries to regenerate the sub builder for a node
warp2.5, tries to use the wapr2 nodes within a normal pbs

... --load as for make

More resilience if a build  dies without returning any error
	time out? multiple_timeout and then kill?
	Restart the build? what if the shell was a fixed one?
	we must keep info on which node was being build
	
Catch ^C when building and die nicely
	=> show what builders we are killing and what they were building
	=> generate warp file
		=> complicated as warp needs the inserted files list and C can happend at any place
		=> none of the build files will get their md5, this means next run will be slow anyhow
	
distributor should be more dynamic than just handing a shell, they should be called when scheduling a node too.


...Should the build directory be based on a warp signature?
	on hold till we decide how to differenciate them for the user
		md5 is not user friendly
	what if we want to reuse most of what is in the out directory even
		if the config is slightely diffrent

what about a specialized filesystem to speedup dependency?
	we "serialize" the dependency tree and let the filesystem do the triggering
	this allows us to very fast know if a whole subtree has been modified or not
	Problems to be fixed:
		How do we serialize?
			FUSE FAm nullfs overlayfs portalfs
			
			each warp has a unique signature, we can keep a list of dependent in a warp signed file
			each file in a dependency file get a 'special' file named: warp_sig +  filename (ie X) in the
				directory where the file is. The fs checks that file (and all other special file with
				other warp sig for file X). The trace file (the special file) for a given warp signature 
				contains a list of all the dependent to file X and the location where to write the trace data
				if file X was to be changed. It could also contain the original md5 of file X.
				It would make sense to have the trace file to be a perl script that is evaled from the fs,
				this would be effective if we embed a perl interpreter into the fs, this would free the fs
				from the logic internals. All that need to be done is eval a file if it exists.
				
				If a perl evaluable trace file solution is choosen, this could be done:
					- check the md5 before doing anything else
					- write the list of dependent where the original warp file
						warp3 would evaluate the file to removes the nodes that need rebuild
					  alternatively we could link/move the signature file to avoid writting alltogether
					- a background build can be started  

				trace file should fire if the file is removed too
				
				? Could we remove the trace file? This would "trigger" a build just once.

		Multiple users, project, configs. Sometimes a single project might have multiple configs
			=> no problems with these says ALI
			
		?How do we detect if a files is fiddled with outside the fs control
			we can't gurantee it  => md5
			use warp1
			disable access in normal fs
			
	@ since we follow warp signature, we can find the sytem that had the dependencies
		the sytem needs to be rebuild when one of the dependencies is changed
		this means that we can start a build when a dependency changes thus having an uptodate
		system (for any of the builds on the fs)
		
		if no auto build is attempted, it is easy to write a tool that finds all the trace file that
		have been moved to the warp file's location thus listing the projects that need rebuild

Warp signature should depend on all the configs not only a choosen few
	problem with PBS setting data in config after warp checked the config
		=> PBS shouldn't do that and should require the config to be set properly befor pbs() is called
		=> we could separate setup data from run time data and generate signature from setup only
	if the config is set properly to start with, the warp signature computation always returns the same value
		=> cache the warp signature => cache the filename directely
	shouldn't we be dependent ont prfs content instead for its name
		we shouldn't use it at all but use the config instead after it has included the prf contents
	... warp file must md5 itself to avoid warp file corruption
		put this in a separate file
		? isn't this overkill ? who is going to change a warp file?
	#=> move $number_nodes_in_DT to the end and check for defined or not
      
Check the header file override problem
	must add include path
		=> change in the pbsfile
		=> must be documented

Can we distribute the pre-processing for distcc
	1/ let n boxes run pbs till the dependency tree is buils on all boxes (fs are synched)
		all boxes get the same build sequence
		the master builder gives a slice of nodes to build to the slave builders
		fs are synched
		
	2/ synch the needed files to the slave (do this smartly by building the nodes that have the same dependencies on the same box)
		by remoting the distcc call to another box, synch of the dependencies must be done to  the builder box
		if gcc is used instead for distcc, we get a normal remote shell build except for the synch (instead for nfs)
		if we remote multiple builds and use distcc, we get part of the parallel build pre processed on the slave box
			and the compilation distributed by distcc
		!! no need to install the any files on the slave box as the needed dependencies are automatically synched! we have the md5s

Can we distribute the dependency step
	fs are synched
	Distribute the subpbs
	each subpbs tree becomes the head of a pbs on the slave box.
	the master box (eventually) merges the build sequences and parralelize it to the slave boxes
	the config for the the common nodes (which exist on all boxes) must be verified as no linking can be done remotely
	if only few nodes are common they can be build on all boxes anyway, simplifying the parallelizer and build step
	when a common node is build on a specific slave, it must be synched to the other slaves waiting fot it
		best is to keep the nodes with dependencies on a shared medium.
	
	configurating, on the slave box, which subpbs is run on which box can be:
		- dynamic
		- simply through a local text file local text file can add rule with post depend which removes all nodes not to 
			be handled localy	another text file could also define the distributor/build_sequencer
	
_pralellelisation of build is not optimal, build parents before terminal nodes.

Unify color used by -dji

Check variable names .....
	use check_word.pl (using PPI)

find all output strings and check them (ex parrallel)
	
Caching of PbsUse 
	red pen analysis done. => Intricate, might be possible in PBS2
	is it possible to get an eval reference?

Add information to node information dump
	#shell => display_shell_info gives a good enough result
	commands when using -ni => difficult as commandes are embeded within a closure
		=> commands should be added to the dependency tree when the nodes are created

... __BUILD_DONE, __BUILD_FAILED and fields set by builder subs should be done in the main process when using -j 
	maybe we should have a generic protocol ,between the worker and controller, to set attributes
	when re-written pbs OO, the node members could be remapped to a write data remotely
	the protocole is needed for warp2 as only the builder can return a list od subs or shell commands
	#-j 2 -warp needs 2 runs before doing nothing => because of missing __BUILD_DONE

have an "insertion line" field instead for adding it to the "insertion file" on -o

make it easy to regenerate a build from a log, including versions/md5 for the files
	having the md5 for the files doesn't help if we can't find the files anymore
	maybe we should make a tar ball with the files and the build system instead

generate a list of the shell commands (and perl sub stubs) that are needed to:
	# Add __BUILD_COMMANDS
	generate the whole build as if it didn't exists
	generate the missing part of the build
	
	This is warp 2! We need to rebuild the dependency tree when one of the node to be rebuild
	has a perl sub dependency. If no perl sub dependency exists, re-running the shell comands
	should be trivial and no require any dependency tree rebuild. even if part of the nodes
	are build by perl subs, we could run the rules on those nodes only not all the nodes.
	===>>> in fact we don't need to run the rule on the node as we know which rule is to 
			build the node, we could simply set the builder from the rule list if there is no
			builder argument. Running the rule to set the builder is in any case cheap.
	should warp2 regenerate the warp tree? ie when an error occures next run in W2 doesn't have the fields set????

dump tree in SVG
	needs to be embeded in html

support for autoconf ?
	generate a define list from the autoconf generate header file
	=> check autoconf perl module

Do we need a cache like CCache?
	=> NFS is bad! a local cache seems like a very good idea
	=> CCache make it worse localy!!!
	How do we search for a node in multiple repositories instead for stopping at the first found
	and eventualy rebuild while another node in the other repositories might match

Add switch for only showing a nodes data without it's child nodes data.
	! good idea but not possible before we type the nodes or use ^__ for all non node fields
	tying and blessing are orthognal but we still need to change all code that expects a HASH to a PBS::Node
	? should we bless or tag

... Defered build: build only what is needed to work now but Q the less important nodes (ex doc)
	should this be a rule attribute?
	should we let the user define new attributes and handlers?
		GenerateDepender verifies that the rule type is one of the registred types
	?! why should PBS be involved here? this has to do with builder and PBS knows nothing about builders

Display: do not display build name if it's the same as the node name (for the html documentation)
-gtg_html: insertion rule looks weird!

PBS server could cache the subs only and we keep the tree in warp form.
	it should be possible to re-generate the subs if necessary
	the warp file could keep a guid for the builder sub to facilitate finding it when needed

give OO interface as well as non OO interface:
	we should be able to start independent builds (OO interface) but let the builds use non OO interface in the pbsfiles.

Make Pbs a build server. Computes build sequence from rules. Rules come from clients written in any language.

Build server could cache the Pbsfiles and the dependency tree for next run
	Check phase could be replaced by MD5 verification (sortof warp on live data)
	
Warp2. Generate a "perfect" monolitic build system for the configuration at hand. (we still run rules)

Warp2-3. Extend Warp1 with build code that can be evaled and run when needed without needing to load Pbsfiles.

Warp3. Look at the warp tree like a build sequence instead for like a dependency tree. The build sequence becoming PBS

Warp4 when a warp3 build sequence must be rebuilt, only the changed part is re-generated.


? how de we handle ['./inc/file' => 'file'] so it works ?
	=> use TARGET PATH
	=> use real depender

Check and document LOCAL_NODES
	warp works fine with local nodes even if the inserted files do not contain all nodes
		because the nodes removed from the warp tree go up to the root
		and the 'root' is always in the primary inserted node list.
		

package PBS + perl + build system + source so it can be distributed.

Front end in other languages: python, ruby, ... ?

-warp and -j when the terminal nodes are already build.

C depender should evaluate -I pathes to reduce . and ..

triggers and subpbs are virtualy the same
	instead for linking the node by hand in a subpbs, simply link it from the inserted nodes

add ./ to targets at PBS::PBS start BUT not when defining the root rule, or ??

Bundle

gtg_gm 1+ seems to crash GraphViz when used with gtg_p

Re-intrency

_ redirect stdout/err to file even when not using -j

_ INHERITANCE of PBS_CONFIG and CONFIG should be done through reference and override instead for copy

##############################   Done   ########################################

#Get the C depender (and other dependers) to exclusively use PBS md5 functions instead for defining it's own. 
	Let PBS check the C digest
	=> used warp1_5

#Warp 1.0 (new) and 1.1 fail regenerating when an error occured
#... remove all non perl language interface: ie use regexes
#... simplified language could translate to perl regex.
	# add the possibility to 'PbsUse' the translator => see language directory

	=> fixed but discuss fix with Ali

#^Log of 230_000 lines for 700 nodes is a bit overkill
	#this is a good candidate for a plugin

#add file name filtering function
	? through a pbs config, ie AddPbsConfig DEPENDENCY_NAME_VALIDATOR => sub{} or regex

#Triggers use simplified regex and should use perl regex instead
	=> had to temporarely add GenerateSimplifiedDependentRegex to Trigger.pm
		so it could pass tests

#Subpbs regex definition should use pure perl or be overridden
	=> hmm think it is already a regex

#AndMatch should not assume code but verify it at 
	PerlBuildSystem-0.28_10/PBSLib/Dependers/Matchers.pm' line 68.

! use make as a distributor !!!
  make consumes 2M before it gets any input, so no significant memory saving
  compared to Perl Build Server.

! -dac should be better indented and give better info in a better format
	#verbose but not so bad
	=> maybe a regex for what keys and/or packages and/or pbsfiles could be good

!can we thread the depend step too?
	yes, and merge nodes if they should be linked but what's the use? there is very little IO involved so threading doesn't help
		better to distribute it

!Add insertion time to node display

!generate tree with color graduation depending on the insertion time
!Rule to verify that no C files are forgotten in the directories from where we get source for the build ? (repository??)

!Revise the fact that all the dependers are run. We could mark some of the rules as terminal and speed up the depend step.

!?top level Pbsfile modification should make all sub levels rebuild because of the parent configuration change.
	Supbs are NOT dependent on their parents config. Every config that should be used in a subpbs digest must be declared. We could introduce a function to do that.

#Give more info when ignoring a builder.
	=> What builder will be used
	
#wizards are broken

#META_NODE 2
	one command generates multiple nodes
	=> this can be implemented independentely from PBS by letting the builder "know"
		if it has already been run or not
	
#--ni is broken

#How do we mark a perl sub builder as only using shell commands?
	should those be run just to generate the commands so we can remote them?
		=> added it as rule attribute
		
# time_builders should show time spend in nodes build by perl subs versus node not using perl subs in their builder

#should -bni show more about the builder, specially USES_PERL_SUB ?


!log plugins calls

#look at all the switched so silent mode is default

#Total build time is not displayed in forked build

#Warp file version is not verified
	in warp file
	in C dependency files
	
#Env variable do not work as targets in PRF file.

#AddEnvironementDependencies has an extra e

#Add "No matching rules" when a node fails to build and it has no rule matching

!How to handle configuration setting at subpbs level
	=> run project but filter which subpbs comes in => always up to data config
	=> dump an evaluable config at each subpbs level and add a use config switch
	=> Do as in Nailara

	=> Can be handled like in Nailara; PROJECT_CONFIG on
	command-line, ...


!Can't we reduce the dependency tree on the fly (warpification) when all the data are not needed
	=> doesn't seem to change a lot
	what about serializing the live data once in a while?

#^Forced doesn't work with warp 1.5

#^^problem with cyclic dependencies that desappear.
	=> this was fixed once already! 
	had to do with cycle desapearing because of linking when mergin the C dependencies cache (I believe)


#PBS_CONFIG should be reduced before it is passed to PBS
	# no diffrence
	
#parallel builders should use a single communication channel

#silent mode should be default
	=> builder process output should only be displayed when error occurs
		=>support was added to Forked.pm but is not used yet.
		
	=> this is even more true for parallel build where display is
	so fast that it makes no sense and uses resources for nothing

#progressbar in depender
	=> heuuu?
	=> DISPLAY_COMPACT_DEPEND_INFORMATION

#type creator should be added through node sub
	=> not possible as it is used before node subs are run. Cleaned it a bit though
	
#Compute a newly build node MD5 directely after its build as it is fresh in the cache
	=> Generating Warp 1.5 takes 30 seconds
	
!Computing the build sequence while checking a warp 1.5 tree is trivial
	=> it's also possible to take a "full" build sequence and remove nodes that are not to be build from it
		parallelisation is more complicated in this case
		
	=> when running warp, the checking is only done on unbuild nodes (warp checks the build nodes)
		in obigo world the checking only takes 2 seconds for 5000 nodes

!Derefer builder generation till the node need to be build
	=>we could get PBS run time errors instead for PBS "compilation" time errors
	# faster depend => in argus2_test diffrence is 5/100th s
	lower memory usage
	
!install pbslib directory

#? add a perldoc like documentation that would extract the function help directly from the modules
	? pod::find + Pod::Select + Pod::Text

!Should the md5 of a C file be generated from the pre-processed source?
	what if we generate documentation automatically from comments? => wouldn't work anymore

#!plugin should be dynamically loaded instead for batch loaded (? should they)

#!Addconfig XX => undef ;
	=> undef is a value like any other but we need to document this behaviour

#!Clarify Hosted vs Distributed shell and how to use them
	? where

#!make xx.c.depend files depend on the depender module => nothing depends on PBS so far

#TIME_STAMP_SYNCHRONIZING for c files could be entirely removed!

#named user defined dump filter ex: -tdhtml -tuf only_names.pl
	write a wizard for a 'tuf'
	the whole --tt could be moved to a user post build module instead for being in PBS
	we should be able to queu post build scripts
	we could pre process the command line to add user specific switches instead for long post_build commands (ie -tt => --post_build something.pl)
	we must also display help for those user defined switches
	user defined switches should always start with a specific letter or letter group
	the user plugins could be set in a specific directory and found automatically

!? lock directories, if the directory is locked and the lock id hasn't changed then no
	node under the directory has changed and needs to be checked or rebuild, just used

#!? --preamble --postamble 

#Understand: __PBS_FORCE_TRIGGER
	The C depender can find out that the C file must be rebuild, it
	adds a __PBS_FORCE_TRIGGER dependency to the C file dependencies.
	PBS will force a triggerring when this dependency is found.
	Rule/C_Depender handles _all_ the dependencies for a C file because
	we do not generate digest for H files. Something must trigger from 
	the H	files level => C_depender with __PBS_FORCE_TRIGGER

#!number of build threads could be dynamic

#keep all commands output for post analysis, ie # warnings , their types .... => on switch only
	--post_node_build perls_script.pl (per node only, no global loggin, the user perl sub can do that if it wishes)
	=> --kpbb
	
#Verify existance of post_pbs file before running.
	#error message too verbose

#Look at Make::Cache and Schedule::Load

#we also want to define which shell is going to build a node
	!when the node is created
	!when creating the build sequence
	#when scheduling the node => the distributor get access to the build sequence and can set unique shells for a node

#remove unnecessary code from triggers
#comment format for triggers input data
#add triger sub => was already done

#dump of triggered tree should show inter trees dependencies

#Let PbsUse take a list of files

#We have two implementation of Md5Tagger!
#we have two GenerateWarpFile!

#partial warp / lock / unlock from command line
	? dynamic load of warp componants ?
	=> simply consider the componants to be final instead for try to depend them!
	
#Sequential Build should also honor -kpbb
	=> let -j 1 handle this

#Can warp be made faster by creating a build sequence and use it as
	a list of md5 instead for having the warp tree and checking the md5 
	by traversing it.
	? do we even need to have a warp tree?
		=> the tree is what gives us the dependencies between nodes thus which node
			to remove when one file has changed. This could be replaced by another
			structure (list of dependents) so we don't need to run PBS to find out what
			nodes are to be removed from the %inserted_nodes. The list should be ordered
			so we can eliminate nodes instead for checking their md5.
			
	#We shouldn't need to count the nodes in the warp tree! We know that
		when we write the warp tree
	=> implemented in warp 1.5
	
#what if the source directories are added to the C depend file forcing a rebuild?
#	C file dependency cache is dependent on CFALGS_INCLUDES thus forcing a rebuild

#Output subs should check their input for undef

#AddConfigVariableDependency
#AddNodeConfigVariableDependency
#	AddVariableDependency is evaluated when the function is called
#	AddConfigVariableDependency is evaluated when the digest is generated


#define documentation command line syntax
#pbsdoc -f -s ?? info page?? => generate html documentation with links

#^Virtual nodes have no digest and can be dependent on source file that have no digest themselves
	=> Have a null builder for the file
	
#Shouldn't trigger inserted roots (in warp) be ordered to guaranty the same build order every time ?

#vi out_nadim/nailara/os/mem/poolheap/PoolHeap_AllocAndFree.o !!!????

#rebuilding without warp after a warp build does build stuff !??????
	Warp should update the rebuild nodee digest so running a non warp after a warp doesn't force a rebuild

#Warp 1.1 doesn't support Triggered tree

#Warp 1.0 erroneously reuse the dependency tree it has evaled! it should use the one returned by PBS::PBS::Pbs

#Config options can be call global
#	AddConfigTo 'color:SILENT_OVERRIDE' =>
#		 white => [0 0 0]

#AddPostBuildRule has arguments, should we keep them?

#?  seems that the dependers ar not passed all the arguments they expect
	=> they are in the rule context

#Generalize AddRule to take a sub instead for a build argument
	AddRule 'name', [], builder, '-02' becomes AddRule 'name', [], builder, BuilderArgument('-02')
	Could be used for: HostedBuilder, debugging (though -d is better)
	? who is going to run the sub, the builder, the depender, ... 
	
	Should Rules also have a sub run when a node is created
		AddRule 'xx', [], undef, args, [sub, sub, sub]
			=> replace args with the more generic sub
		This can be used for
			- arguments
			- node builder timeout
			- host shell
			- config
			- pbs config
			!- subpbs
			!- ruleset( exclusive, additive substractive)
			!- exclude from digest
			!- debuging ??
			!- post_build_rule
			
	
	the subs can be defined in modules that need the information later when building the node
	
	
#-warp can't run when no build is made as the build generates data for warp

#colorgcc doesn't color if stdout is not TTY.
	the problem came from colorgcc which doesn't color if stdout is not a tty
	another problem (bug) was that colorgcc added an ANSI reset code for lines that are

#how to have the same node with multiple configurations
	when linking, check the config
	if config is diffrent push a new config in the node instead for a new node in the tree
	check the node for each config
